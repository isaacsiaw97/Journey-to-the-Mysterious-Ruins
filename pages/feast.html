						<h3>The Feast</h3>
						<p>The King wanted to create a feast that captured the essence of all the adventures he had heard. So he called up his chefs and told them his demands. The chefs got to work one by one, but the King knew that <i>too many cooks would spoil the broth</i> so he ordered the chefs to make changes one by one.</p>

						<p><b>Rules:</b> A dish consists of a single common English word; dishes must be valid after every step. If a step would change two adjacent dishes so theyâ€™re no longer valid dishes, put them on the same plate if it would make them a valid dish.</p>

						<p>A Chef replaced a 4 letter word for another that described it.</p>
						<p>Another replaced a flower with one that brought good luck.</p>
						<p>The next chef doubled a dish.</p>
						<p>A dish was replaced with something similar that provided more action.</p>
						<p>When it was heard that the adventurers did not like Ls, They were removed from every dish.</p>
						<p>As a finishing touch, a chef removed a pinch of opposing ends of adjacent dishes to make a single absolute.</p>
						<p>With a plate now empty, a chef took the middle letter out of a dish and split it into 2.</p>
						<p>A vehicle was replaced by something of the same size that gave a friendly push.</p>
						<p>A pair of adjacent dishes were swapped to look nicer.</p>
						<p>However, the adventurers couldn't wait much longer and ate all the <b>JAM</b> and <b>SHROOMS</b> from the feast!</p>
						<p>In an attempt to save the dishes, a chef swapped out the front of a dish to enforce some order.</p>
