We shall pay you to explore these suspicions and you will be free to keep any treasure you might discover. Feel free to take something from the royal armory, but you might have to sort through the broken weapons to find anything worth bringing along."</h2>

						<h2 class="twelve-columns vertical-center" style="margin-bottom:80px;">Congratulations on completing <i>Journey to the Mysterious Ruins!</i> The adventurers have learnt that many things have hidden meanings that guide their way forward while the King himself was reminded by his predecessor that people should not be judged by their appearences and preliminary behaviours. We hope that you have enjoyed the puzzles (even if you might have needed to skip a few) and also learnt that both events and people should not be merely taken at face value.</h2>
